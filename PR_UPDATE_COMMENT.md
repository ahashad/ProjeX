## 📋 **Important Update: Development Roadmap Added**

I've added a comprehensive **Development Roadmap** (`DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`) to this PR to prevent duplicate work and provide clear visibility into the implementation progress.

### 🎯 **What's Included:**

#### **Complete Task Breakdown:**
- ✅ **Completed Phases** (1-2): Core planning and team management foundation
- 🔄 **In Progress** (Phase 3): Resource management enhancements  
- 📋 **Pending Phases** (4-12): Detailed task checklists for remaining work

#### **Progress Tracking:**
- **Overall Progress**: 25% complete (2 of 12 phases)
- **Milestone Definitions**: Clear checkpoints for each phase
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identifies blockers and prerequisites
- **Task Ownership**: Prevents duplicate development efforts

#### **Key Documents Added:**
1. **`DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`** - Master implementation checklist
2. **`implementation_plan.md`** - Technical architecture plan  
3. **`todo.md`** - Current phase task tracking

### 🔍 **Benefits:**
- **Prevents Duplicate Work**: Clear visibility into completed vs pending tasks
- **Systematic Development**: Logical sequencing of implementation phases
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking of development status
- **Team Coordination**: Clear task ownership and dependencies
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation checkpoints

### 📊 **Current Status:**
- **Phases 1-2**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (Core foundation with paths, budgets, enhanced assignments)
- **Phase 3**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (Resource management frontend components)
- **Phases 4-12**: 📋 **PENDING** (Advanced features and system completion)

This roadmap ensures we systematically implement all requirements from `business_logic_workflow.md` without missing any functionality or duplicating efforts. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a robust and comprehensive project management system.

The roadmap will be continuously updated as development progresses, providing a living document for tracking implementation status.
