# ProjeX - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for completing all remaining functionalities in the ProjeX Blazor application, based on the `business_logic_workflow.md` specification. The plan is divided into phases, each with specific tasks, priorities, and deliverables.

## 2. Core Principles & Global Policies
These principles will be implemented as cross-cutting concerns throughout the application:

- **Date Integrity**: Add validation to all date-related inputs to ensure they fall within the project's start and end dates.
- **Capacity Integrity**: Implement validation for resource allocation to prevent exceeding capacity.
- **Single Owner per Deliverable**: Enforce this rule in the deliverable assignment logic.
- **Separation of Duties**: Implement approval workflows with role-based checks.
- **Auditability**: Enhance the existing audit interceptor to capture more detailed information.
- **Localization & Calendar**: Integrate a calendar component that respects user's locale and holidays.
- **Data Completeness**: Add validation attributes to all mandatory fields in DTOs and entities.
- **Exception Management**: Implement a system for handling and logging exceptions with justifications.
